# Object Oriented Programming Principles in JavaScript

**Tried to understand OOPs in JavaScript with a Banking System example**

Understood:
 - Fundamental intuition behind class and object way of orgainising code
 - How it differs from other Programming languages
 - Traditional yet "unique" way of doing OOP Programming using `function`
 - Prototypes
 - Prototypal Inheritance
 - Classes (ES6)
